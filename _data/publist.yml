  image: Emergence.jpg
  description: Alongside studies that extend traditional focus on control-based regulation of structural parameters (channel densities), there is a budding interest in self-organization of kinetic parameters. In this picture, ionic channels are continually forced by activity in-and-out of a pool of states not available for the mechanism of excitability. The process, acting on expressed structure, provides a bed for generation of a spectrum of excitability modes.

- title: "Interaction between duration of activity and time course of recovery from slow inactivation in mammalian brain Na+ channels"
  image: Interaction.jpg
  description: The relationships between activity and availability for activation of voltage gated Na channels were examined using the Xenopus expression system. The main point of this work is that the time constant of recovery from the unavailable (inactivated) pool is related to the duration of previous activation by a power law. These relationships extend from tens of milliseconds to several minutes and are intrinsic to the channel protein

- title: "Self-organized criticality in single-neuron excitability"
  image: self-organized.JPG
  description:  Here, we suggest that neuronal response fluctuations reflect a process that positions the neuron near a transition point that separates excitable and unexcitable phases. This view is supported by the dynamical properties of the system as observed in experiments on isolated cultured cortical neurons, and by a theoretical mapping between the constructs of self-organized criticality and membrane excitability.

  description: Neuronal dynamics is intrinsically unstable, producing activity fluctuations that are essentially scale free. Here we experimentally study single cortical neurons, and show that while these scale-free fluctuations are independent of temporal input statistics, they can be entrained by input variation. Response entrainment was found to be maximal when the input itself possesses natural-like, scale-free statistics

This paper ofers a self-regulating ‘automatic’ mechanisms that contribute to neuronal resilience by virtue of the kinetic properties of ion channels themselves

  description: The results presented here demonstrate selective learning in a network of real cortical neurons, without the involvement of a neural rewarding entity. The connectivity can be modulated by external focal stimulation in an activity-dependent manner. Most importantly, the networks explore the space of possible responses and stabilize at configurations that remove the stimuli.

We focus on selective adaptation to frequent and rare stimuli; networks were stimulated at two sites with two different stimulus frequencies.

- title: "Order-Based Representation in Random Networks of Cortical Neurons"

  description: We show that in spontaneously developing large-scale random networks of cortical neurons in vitro the order in which neurons are recruited following each stimulus is a naturally emerging representation primitive that is invariant to significant temporal changes in spike times. With a relatively small number of randomly sampled neurons, the information about stimulus position is fully retrievable from the recruitment order

We show that the basic mode of assembly activation, “network spike,” is a threshold-governed phenomenon, following the logistics of neuronal recruitment in an effectively scale-free connected network

  description: In this perspective we demonstrate that application of reverse engineering to the study of the design principle of a functional neuro-system with a known mechanism, may result in a perfectly valid but wrong induction of the system’s design principle. If in the very simple setup we bring here it is difficult to induce a design principle, what are our chances of exposing biological design principles when more realistic conditions are examined?

  description: This monograph is an invitation to a space for dialogue where reflections on neurophysiology are expressed with and guided by depth-psychology in mind; a space where neurophysiology resumes its traditional humbled stance towards matters of the psyche, and where the intellectual autonomy of depth psychology is acknowledged. The author leads the reader through the terrain of methodological errors that have plagued recent reductive approaches, paving the way for a dialogue that is based on an alternative, relational approach.
